        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: <span id="last-updated">December 2025</span></p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website <strong>giftpicksai.com</strong>
          (the “Site”) and our AI-powered gift suggestion tool and related services (collectively, the “Service”).
          By accessing or using the Site or Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          GiftPicks AI provides gift idea suggestions generated with the help of artificial intelligence.
          The Service is intended for personal, non-commercial use. You agree to use the Service only for lawful
          purposes and in compliance with these Terms and applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No professional advice</h2>
        <p>
          The gift ideas and content generated by the Service are for informational and convenience purposes only.
          They do not constitute professional, financial, legal, or other advice. You are solely responsible for your
          purchasing decisions and any outcomes that result from them.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Accuracy and limitations of AI-generated content</h2>
        <p>
          The Service uses AI models to generate suggestions based on the information you provide. While we aim to
          offer helpful and relevant ideas, we do not guarantee that any suggestion will be accurate, suitable, in stock,
          or available at a particular price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Product details, availability, pricing, and shipping options shown on third-party websites (such as online
          retailers) are outside our control and may change at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Affiliate links and third-party sites</h2>
        <p>
          The Site may contain links to third-party websites, including online retailers. Some of these links may be
          <strong>affiliate links</strong>, meaning we may earn a commission if you make a qualifying purchase through those links,
          at no additional cost to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not own or operate these third-party sites and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices.
          Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk and subject to the terms and policies of those sites.
        </p>

        <h2>5. User responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Service for any unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent purpose.</li>
          <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, circumvent, or interfere with the operation of the Site or Service.</li>
          <li>Input content that is illegal, abusive, or infringes the rights of others.</li>
          <li>Use automated tools to scrape, overload, or disrupt the Site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          The Site, including its design, layout, branding, and underlying code, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected
          by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, or distribute the Site or Service content except
          as necessary for your personal, non-commercial use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may make reasonable personal use of the AI-generated suggestions (for example, to help you shop for gifts), but you
          may not resell or repackage the Service as your own commercial product without our prior written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Service availability and changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the Site or Service at any time, with or without notice.
          We are not liable if the Site is unavailable at any time or for any period.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
        <p>
          THE SITE AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,

          WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS,

        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
          CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICE,
          EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE OR SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED

        </p>

        <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Site owner
          is based, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or
          the Service will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.
